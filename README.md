LEARNING POINTS: 
1. I usually use create-react-app immediately, so the most painful part for me was installing the babel transpiler to ensure compatability, and webpack for module bundling to ensure that the dependencies are in correct order
I ran into a lot of error codes, especially with the babel loaders, that led me on a wild chase around StackOverflow
Overall it was a fun experience going under the hood!

sorry if some naming conventions are weird
